<div class="david_desc_text">
Hello, first off, I would like to thank you for actually reading the email,(if you didn't do that beforehand, then please do) and clicking on the link.<br><br>
Secondly, I would like to ask you to vote for me for the position of vice president. One of the reasons I deserve to have that position is that I have been in a leadership position before, and I know my limits, or rather, I know what I'm capable of. <br><br>
Another reason is that I can keep a cool head when I'm being provoked. Because of that, I'm more likely to make rational decisions instead of just bursting out in anger or frustration. <br><br>
A third reason is that I know and understand my flaws. I am well aware that I tend to be annoying at times, and I thank you all for dealing with me for this long(that is, if you know me at all). I will work to erase most of my flaws, and make my strengths much better.<br><br>
